Description: causalTransportR implements a number of estimators to estimate, generalize, and transport causal effects using reweighting doubly-robust score functions with transformations of selection scores to generalize and/or transport causal effects. All nuisance functions are cross-fit using fast supervised learning algorithms (grf and glmnet).
