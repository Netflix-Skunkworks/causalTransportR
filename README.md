# `causalTransportR` : a package for bridging causal effects to new or general populations

causalTransportR implements a number of estimators to generalize and transport causal effects by reweighting doubly-robust score functions with transformations of selection scores to generalize and/or transport causal effects. All nuisance functions are cross-fit using fast supervised learning algorithms.
